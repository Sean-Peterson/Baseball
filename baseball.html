      For more than a century, baseball has been labeled the “national pastime.” <span>American</span> youths have taken to Little <span>League</span> parks and baseball <span>diamonds</span> for <span>generations</span>. The song "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" is part of American lore. Writers have rhapsodized about the game in their novels and histories while movie studios have released blockbuster films like Field of Dreams, A League of Their Own and Moneyball.

      <span>Economics. Leadership. Immigration.</span> The quest for freedom. Equal rights. The Information Age. Veterans. Even storytelling. These are among the ways in which this sport connects with Americans at a deep level. They also are why baseball still matters. The game provides a lens into our very society and remains one of America’s most reliable means of connecting generations.
