      Strategic thinking by baseball’s leaders was required to open the path to racial equality and free market opportunity, just as strategists like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Thurgood Marshall planned the social and legal path to equal opportunity for African-Americans in the 1950s.

Branch Rickey played the most important strategist role in integrating professional baseball, earning him the title of baseball’s “Great Emancipator.” Rickey was the Dodgers president who signed Jackie Robinson and partnered with him in breaking MLB's color barrier. He did not sign Robinson simply because he believed it was the morally correct thing to do. Rickey also did it because having Robinson in his lineup made the Dodgers a better ballclub. In Robinson's first year in Brooklyn, he led the team to the National League pennant and won Rookie of the Year honors.

As with the larger national struggle for civil rights, the integration of baseball did not come easily or without ugly incidents. But it did come, and the game benefited from the change. So did America.

Unfortunately, the participation of African-American ballplayers has declined dramatically in recent years. Baseball is a hard sport to play without a field, which can be hard to find in America’s inner cities or poorer neighborhoods. Major League Baseball has tried to deal with this problem by providing funding to build fields in neighborhoods that lack them.

This may be one of the game’s most pressing challenges, and, in many respects, it mirrors the challenge that urban leaders across America face: How can they rebuild their inner cities and neglected neighborhoods?

Baseball and Economics
Nowhere does baseball mirror American life more than in economics. This is true whether the issue is management/labor tension, free agency and the atomization of the workforce, or managing a complex organization.

The most serious management/labor dispute ended the 1994 season. As president, Bill Clinton tried to keep the game from finishing in a strike. He convened both sides at the White House, met with negotiators, and even tried to get Congress to impose binding arbitration. Unfortunately, his efforts did not succeed. The sides could not resolve their differences, and the season ended bitterly with the cancellation of the World Series.

The right of players to leave their existing teams and sign as free agents with other clubs constituted its own protracted, disputed struggle from the 1970s through the mid-1990s. Players eventually won the right to market their services to the team of their choice, thanks in part to Curt Flood, the St. Louis Cardinal star outfielder who rejected a trade to the Philadelphia Phillies in 1969. He opposed the trade because he thought baseball’s reserve clause gave team owners too much control over ballplayers’ economic freedom and prevented them from becoming free agents.

Flood fought his case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, but ultimately lost. His case did galvanize other players and, by the middle 1970s, the sport was on its way to allowing free agency for veteran players.

At the same time baseball was figuring out free agency, the American workforce was about to experience its own major shift. The technology revolution would soon make employees more individualized units of production. Like baseball’s free agents signing with three or four franchises during their careers, employees found themselves on paths to multiple jobs during their working years. No longer would they be tethered to a single employer for a lifetime.

For players, free agency meant a rapid escalation in salaries. They were able to use the marketplace to get a better deal. Perhaps the most eye-striking contrast with today’s players is the salary of the legendary Hank Aaron, who toppled Babe Ruth's career home run record in 1973. Aaron earned at most an annual salary of $250,000, and it came at the end of his standout career.

In 2015, the average salary of a major league player is more than $4 million and guaranteed contracts in excess of $100 million over several years is not unusual. Even when adjusted for inflation, Aaron’s highest annual salary was less than $1 million in today’s dollars.

Eye-popping salaries have rewarded some athletes with economic security for life, though they have also created the game's own wealth gap. The 2015 Texas Rangers' highest-paid player, Prince Fielder, will make $24 million this season, while about half of his teammates will receive the guaranteed minimum MLB salary of $500,000.

High-dollar salaries also make the economics of running a big league team challenging, causing the Los Angeles Dodger and Texas Rangers to recently go through reorganization proceedings in bankruptcy court.

Regardless of their size, modern ballplayers’ salaries are a product of supply-and-demand, the ultimate market principle. The 30 MLB clubs carry rosters with 25 players each. (Teams are allowed 40-man rosters late in each season.) Given the vast number of ballplayers around the world, and the reality of market economics, those who make it to the big leagues and become accomplished stars there, naturally draw high salaries.

With increased technology, baseball has become a more sophisticated game in the Information Age. Each new year bring new data and performance measurements that drive decisions about lineups, field positioning, and pitching matchups. This is no different from how waves of data drive decision-making in such fields as finance, medicine and education.

Moneyball, Michael Lewis' best-seller about the modern game, explained how number-crunching professionals increasingly influence baseball. With each passing year, general managers, scouts, and managers collect and then use more information about the tendencies of their own players as well of players on opposing teams. As a manager, Tony LaRussa made full use of every piece of computerized information to micromanage his Oakland Athletics and St. Louis Cardinals to World Series championships.

Yet long before technology helped baseball develop sophisticated metrics, managers constantly innovated and were their own dynamic market force.

George Will wrote in Men at Work, his 1990 study of the craft of baseball:

"Baseball is an exacting profession with a technical vocabulary and a distinctive mode of reasoning. It involves constant attention to the law of cumulation, which is: A lot of little things add up, through 162 games, 1,458 innings, to big differences. A 162-game season is, like life, an exercise in cumulation."

Casey Stengel implemented the platoon system of creating lineups, recognizing that left-handed batters typically succeed more often when facing right-handed pitchers, and vice versa. Connie Mack began the practice of analyzing hitters’ weaknesses and then getting pitchers to take advantage of those weaknesses. Gene Mauch got his pitchers to vary their delivery in order to prevent base runners from getting too big of a lead before attempting to steal a base.

So, yes, baseball is a game and an athletic contest, but it also has provided a snapshot into the forces at play in a market economy. For that reason alone, the sport demands our attention.

The art of leadership is another way the sport demands our attention. Beyond the data-driven dugout decisions, or even the manager simply playing a hunch, there is the operation of Major League Baseball itself.
